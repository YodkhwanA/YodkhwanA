# Hi there ݁ ˖Ი𐑼⋆
I'm **Yofu / Yofunni**, a game art student. I create 2D illustrations and am interested in 3D sculpting.<br/>
Currently pursuing a degree in Game Design while preparing to become a game artist.<br/>

I’m interested in various roles, including 2D artist, 3D artist, and animator. I also have 2–3 game project ideas that I’d love to start working on. I just need to study coding a bit more first LOL

🖥 **Tool**: Procreate [INSTAGRAM](https://www.instagram.com/byyofu_/), [BLUESKY](https://bsky.app/profile/fu13yo.bsky.social) / Blender, Maya / Davinci Resolve, Capcut [TIKTOK](https://www.tiktok.com/@jorurunna_) / Unity, Unreal<br/>
